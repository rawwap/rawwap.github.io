<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am **Anpeng Wang (王安鹏)**, currently an undergraduate student majoring in Robotics Engineering at the School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University. Academically, I am fortunate to study under the supervision of Professor [Runmin Cong](https://rmcong.github.io/) and am now affiliated with [Multimedia and Vision Processing Group (MVP Group)](https://rmcong.github.io/MVPLab.html), which is attached to the Key Laboratory of Machine Intelligence and System Control, Ministry of Education.

My core research interests focus on **Zero/Few shot Learning**. Currently, I am conducting relevant exploratory work around these research directions.

Regarding my future academic plan, I have decided to continue pursuing a Master's degree at the School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University starting from 2026, where I will continue to delve deeply into the aforementioned research fields.

If you are interested in any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to contact me via email: [rawwap@mail.sdu.edu.cn](mailto:rawwap@mail.sdu.edu.cn).
